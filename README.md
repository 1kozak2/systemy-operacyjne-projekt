# Dining Philosophers (C++)

## ðŸ§  Project Description

This project is a multithreaded simulation of the classical **Dining Philosophers** problem, implemented in C++ using `std::thread` and a custom synchronization primitive (`SpinLock`).

The goal was to solve the problem without relying on any built-in mutex or semaphore mechanisms. Instead, we implemented thread synchronization manually and safely controlled access to shared resources (forks).
